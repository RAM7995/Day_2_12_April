Javascript vs NodeJS:

1. Javascript is used for writing scripts on websiite
2. used on the client side
3.JS can be run on any browser (spidermonkey-firefox, JS core safari)
4.JS used in front end development
5.can only be run on the browser


NodeJS

1.NodeJS is a javascript runtime envinorment
2. can run JS outside browser using nodejs
3. used on the server side
4. nodejs used in server side development
5. V8 is the JS engine inside of node.js that parses and runs JS.
 

5 points from video:

1.HTML is forgiving in nature, parsing isnt straght forward
2. using script tag at the bottom: parse is uninterrupted, faster to render.

Prototype:

JavaScript is a prototype based language, so, whenever we create a function using JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function, Prototype property is basically an object (also known as Prototype object), where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
